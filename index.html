                Hi! I'm Phi, an aspiring software developer that aims to strengthen my skills in computer science and secure a job by doing what I love:
            </p>
            <span class="blurb">Solving Problems.</span>
            <p class="blurb">
                My first exposure to computer science was through a game called "Little Big Planet 2." You could use AND or OR gates to provide logic in custom stages and add properties to objects, 
                bringing unlimited creativity to the table. As a kid, I had no idea what these were, but come AP Computer Science in high school, I was excited to piece this memory to real applications. 
                During this time, I learned to think like a programmer. In university, I ended up majoring Public Health, thinking I would be come a physician assistant, but part of me had a love for 
                programming, and I enrolled in the Elements of Programming certificate at UT Austin while finishing my degree. I deeply enjoying helping people in need, but also cannot ignore the fact that 
                my brain loves solving problems and being creative with programming. I hope one day that I can combine these two passions in my near future.
        
                I have worked with an assortment of computer languages and would say I am well-versed in Python. However, I have created projects in HTML, javaScript, CSS, and Java. I also 
                have some knowledge in making queries with SQL, working with MySQL, PostgreSQl, and mongoDB.
